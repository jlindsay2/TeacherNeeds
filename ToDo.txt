- Welcome Page: Links to teachers and linka to Needs list
- Teachers: Have model, seed data, can show list, create new teachers, edit/update teachers
- Teacher Needs: Data and references are good.
    - input new needs for given teacher
    - See all needs or see needs for a given teacher
- Code Control up on GitHub under "TeacherNeeds"
    - Note: one must have Git, make a git repository, remove CRLF line in .gitconfig, share it to GitHub,
        and do a Commit and Push to commit to GitHub.
- TeacherNeed Status
    - when new Need created, it defaults the Status to 'Active'
    - There is checkbox by each item in the full needs list, so they can mark multiple items Filled.
        All items marked Filled are removed from the visible list (they remain in the db).

************* BASIC FUNCTIONALITY TO DO (Version 1.0) *******************
- BUGS TO FIX: none

- IN PROCESS: teacher_needs status (Allowed statuses: "Active", "Filled", "Closed")
    - THEN: From teacher screen remove items they have Closed (Give a feedback message.)
    - THEN: From teacher screen they can edit it, including changing the status
- THEN: Sort All Needs List by (a) Date or (b) Teacher & Date
- THEN: Get it to look decent (do some CSS)
- THEN: Allow the Teacher Needs list to be printed out
- THEN: Beta Test: Two teachers and Atiere

********** HOPEFULLY NEXT VERSION ************
- THEN: Sort by department?
    (Have a Watch List. This would be another model.  One person can see the needs of their watch list.
    This is so that, e.g., a department chair could just watch their people.)
- Use partial forms.
- Test driven development
- Validation
- Privileges / Security / Authentication

************* LATER *******************
- Refactor 'teacher_need' to 'need'?
- Allow "Filled" to be set in bulk
- Teachers: Delete a teacher.
- Email people that supplies have been delivered to their box, their room, or other place
-
