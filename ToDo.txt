- Welcome Page: Links to teachers and linka to Needs list
- Teachers: Have model, seed data, can show list, create new teachers, edit/update teachers
- All Teacher Needs: Data and references are good.
    - See all needs or see needs for a given teacher
    - Can print the list of needs simply from the browser.
    - There is checkbox by each item in the full needs list, so someone meeting a need can mark multiple items Filled.
        All items marked Filled are removed from the visible list (they remain in the db).
- Each Teacher Can:
    - input new needs
    - when new Need created, it defaults the Status to 'Active'
    - see the status of all open needs
    - Teachers can mark their need's status as 'Closed' or 'Active'.
- Code Control up on GitHub under "TeacherNeeds"
    - Note: one must have Git, make a git repository, remove CRLF line in .gitconfig, share it to GitHub,
        and do a Commit and Push to commit to GitHub.
- Got it to look decent (using CSS mainly)
