- Welcome Page: Links to teachers and linka to Needs list
- Teachers: Have model, seed data, can show list, create new teachers, edit/update teachers
- Teacher Needs: Data and references are good.
    - input new needs for given teacher
    - See all needs or see needs for a given teacher
- Code Control up on GitHub under "TeacherNeeds"
    - Note: one must have Git, make a git repository, remove CRLF line in .gitconfig, share it to GitHub,
        and do a Commit and Push to commit to GitHub.
- TeacherNeed Status
    - when new Need created, it defaults the Status to 'Active'

************* BASIC FUNCTIONALITY TO DO (Version 1.0) *******************

- IN PROCESS: teacher_needs status (Allowed statuses: "Active", "Filled", "Closed")
    - THEN: Allow it to be set to "Filled" from the All Needs Screen
        By default show only the Active items.  Have a checkbox by each item so they can take block actions.
    - THEN: From teacher screen they can edit it, including changing the status
    - THEN: From teacher screen remove items they have Closed (Give a feedback message.)
- THEN: Sort All Needs List by (a) Date or (b) Teacher & Date
- THEN: Get it to look decent (do some CSS)
- THEN: Allow it to printed out
- THEN: Beta Test: Two teachers and Atiere

********** HOPEFULLY NEXT VERSION ************
- THEN: Sort by department?
    (Have a Watch List. This would be another model.  One person can see the needs of their watch list.
    This is so that, e.g., a department chair could just watch their people.)
- Use partial forms.
- Test driven development
- Validation
- Privileges / Security

************* LATER *******************
- Refactor 'teacher_need' to 'need'?
- Allow "Filled" to be set in bulk
- Teachers: Delete a teacher.
- Email people that supplies have been delivered to their box, their room, or other place
-
