- Welcome Page: Links to teachers and linka to Needs list
- Teachers: Have model, seed data, can show list, create new teachers, edit/update teachers
- All Teacher Needs: Data and references are good.
    - See all needs or see needs for a given teacher
    - Can print the list of needs simply from the browser.
    - There is checkbox by each item in the full needs list, so someone meeting a need can mark multiple items Filled.
        All items marked Filled are removed from the visible list (they remain in the db).
- Each Teacher Can:
    - input new needs
    - when new Need created, it defaults the Status to 'Active'
    - see the status of all open needs
    - Teachers can mark their need's status as 'Closed' or 'Active'.
- Code Control up on GitHub under "TeacherNeeds"
    - Note: one must have Git, make a git repository, remove CRLF line in .gitconfig, share it to GitHub,
        and do a Commit and Push to commit to GitHub.
- Got it to look decent (using CSS mainly)
- DEP-0001 -- Get it into production
    * It is running on Heroku at "teacher-needs.herokuapp.com"
    Got Heroku Toobelt installed and running via command line.  Using PostgresSQL now instead of SQLite3.
    Committed code to GitHub.  Connected Heroku to GitHub.  Told Heroku to deploy code in GitHub.
    Migrated db on Heroku.  Renamed URL to "teacher-needs.herokuapp.com".  Fixed some CSS to make UI more attractive.
- BUG-0002 -- Sort Teacher List by Last Name + First Name [build 8]
- BUG-0003 -- If a teacher has no requests in their list, their page looks funky. [build 9]

VERSION 0.2, 8/21/16 10:20pm
FIXED BUG-0005 -- Sorting of Needs should be by original creation date, then by teacher name
